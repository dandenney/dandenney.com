<h1>Front-End Conf '13</h1>
<img alt="Front-End Conf photo booth" width="800" height="533" src="../../assets/images/posts/conferences/front-end-conf-13/131.jpg" />
<p>
We recently wrapped up Front-End Conf 13 and it was awesome. We can't thank everyone enough for all that they do to make it such a good time. While it's a very busy few days, they are filled with these wonderful moments. I can't even explain how awesome it is to meet people attending their first event and see the excitement on their face or to hear the stories of people's paths over the past year. It is truly inspiring.
</p>
<h2>Scaling is Hard</h2>
<p>
We really wanted to go all out for our fifth event and we pulled off a few things that we hadn't done before. With so much information sharing jammed into 3 days, there was less time for getting to meet new people. I know this was true for us and I'm pretty sure that it was for attendees as well.
</p>
<p>
The people are why we do this and we love to get to spend time chatting and hanging out. We'll likely slow things back down a bit for future events.
</p>
<p>
The speakers on Day 2 killed it this year and it has grown to be nearly the size of Day 1, which makes me so happy! I'll need to rethink how to determine who gets the spots next year as I'd like to improve the overall flow of the day.
</p>
<p>
I got a tad too excited about the awesome talks planned for this year's Day 2 and I assumed that things would run similarly to previous ones. We all know what happens when you assume. I'll need to rework the schedule next round so that there is time for Q&A, attendee chatting, and smooth speaker transitions.
</p>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>
Before I share this next bit, I want to be sure to say that as long as we are running Front-End Conf there will be an annual event in St. Petersburg. We have a huge group of people that have supported us and we won't take it away. That said, we do have ideas for other cities and for different events as well. You'll likely see the first location at the end of the video...
