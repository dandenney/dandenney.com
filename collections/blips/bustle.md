[Bustle.com](http://www.bustle.com) came out recently and created a bunch of itself: excited activity and movement. People are up in arms over the amount of money that was raised for the startup ($6.5 million), the claims interpreted as saying that it's the first site for women, and the tech involved in the delivery of the content (primarly the JS templating of Ember). 

I wouldn't have ever stated things in the way the founder did, I wouldn't have dreamed of trying to score 6.5M for a blog and I wouldn't have combined Rails and Ember to deliver the content for a blog. I'm really glad that they did, though. It got my attention because everyone was pissed, but I love the site. The writing is fantastic and it's the best performing content site that I've been on. It instantly became a daily check for me.

The one part I'm probably supposed to be against is using JS for serving up content, but I'm not. I think it is perfect for who they are targeting. They are targeting connected, modern, individuals of which SEO and non-JS browsers are not a concern. Their demographics are using very modern technology and they find and share their information via social networks. 

Would it be an issue if a national news organization did the same thing? Probably. However, Bustle isn't that. My only hope is that they monetize well because I want the site around for a long time.
