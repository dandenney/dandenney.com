If you had to pick a question that the the founder of your company would be continually asking, do you know what it would be? I didn't, until I heard it recently: "What else can we do to make things better for everyone here?"

It was stated as part of a story during a year-end review at Envy. This particular answer was that we should all get "at least two weeks" of paid time off in addition to the holidays. That's an awesome thing, but nowhere near as awesome as knowing that is the mindset.

### We make things better

We have [http://envylabs.com/about](stated core values) but one that isn't listed is this concept of continually looking to make things better. It runs rampant throughout the company, thanks to the leadership and good hiring.

### Iterate everything

As a group of people, we work on a lot of things: client projects, Code School, meetups, open-source projects, podcasts, conferences, conference presentations, etc.

Learn. Improve. Repeat as

Note about improving benefits

Note about how it's really the mantra in everything
