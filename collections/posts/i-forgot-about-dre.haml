    Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
    %br
    but nothin' comes out when they move they lips
    %br
    just a buncha gibberish
    %br
    and muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

  %p
    I'm quite familiar with Eminem's reminder not to forget about Dre, but I did it. I'm not sure that I would have survived the sunny streets of Seminole, FL without Dre and the rest of the N.W.A. crew. (I may have died of boredom.) Anyhow, I've been a Dre fan forever but I'm not a fan of the Beats headphones at all. Their sound quality isn't anything special and they're laughably overpriced. I have just assumed it was one of those random wins where an endorsement worked out really well. 

  %h2 Hot UX you say?
  %p
    I had seen some internet things confirming that Beats Music was a thing that now existed, but I really had no interest based on the headphones and the fact that I already rock Rdio and Spotify subscriptions. (I'm testing Google Play, too.) Then I read
    %a(href="https://medium.com/dear-blank/69f99fc29d1") Rooting for Rdio
    and Aaron Schildkrout opened by saying "This week Beats Music dropped with a shout. A 20mm plus title, hot-UX, curatorial, etc etc blah blah blah music streaming service." Now I was curious.

  %h2 I Need a Doctor!
  %p
    Hot UX was an understatement. This was the best onboarding experience that I've had on an iPhone app and overall it's instantly a competitor with the other players. I used FB to create my account and here was the initial flow.

  %h2 I'm Moody With Music
  %p
    Music is a huge part of my life and I really listen to everything. You'll find everything from Bach to 2Pac in my collection. What I choose to listen to all depends on my mood and what I'm doing. So this "sentence" mode is something I'll use a lot. Going with hip-hop was kind of a softball for Beats Music so I threw it a curveball with an alt lineup too. Both were spot on.

  %h2 The Aftermath
  %p
    The iPhone app rocks, but there isn't an iPad app or a Mac app (yet). The web interface is huott like the iPhone app, but I try to avoid browser playing because of the screeches that happen whenever memory takes a hit. I'm on a 3-month free family trial (Thanks AT&T!) so I'm sure I'll have figured out where it fits by then. I have the feeling that it will replace one of the services, but it will hard to ever leave Rdo based on their Mac app and remote play. 


%style .grid { overflow: hidden; } .grid-box--1of1 { display: block; margin-bottom: 1em; } @media (min-width: 768px) { .grid-box--m--1of3 { float: left; margin: 0 1% 1em 1%; width: 31%; } }
