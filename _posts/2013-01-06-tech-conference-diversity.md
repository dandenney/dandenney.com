The lack of gender diversity in tech conferences hit the tipping point last week. Another all-male lineup was announced and I'm guessing the speaker count being so high added the extra frustration. 

Since then, we have gotten [real pledges](http://support.iawriter.com/help/kb/general-questions/markdown-syntax-reference-guide), [awful satire pledges](http://conferencequotas.com) and countless Twitter arguments.

We could benefit from more diversity in our conference lineups, but the solution isn't any form of affirmative action. We need the people that organize conferences to be considerate and to make an effort to discover new people that would love to share their knowledge and experience. 

I can speak from experience on this one and they are very easy to find.
