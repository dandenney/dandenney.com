		<h1>Hey!</h1>

		<p>Hey! Someone got all up in my Wordpress database and was injecting nastiness. So, I scrapped the site and the db and I'm starting over fresh.</p>

		<p>I'm going to slowly rebuild and I'll share along the way. Gotta grab some font icons, a Typekit account and stuffs like that to start making a site.</p>
