=============

This is my new site.

So, some script kiddies got hold of my Wordpress install and most likely popped in one of those fun MySQL injectors. I've been debating on using a static site generator for a bit but I'm going to do something a little crazy. 

I'm inspired by Zeldman's recent post about personal sites being playgrounds and experimental. Mine used to be all the time. Also, now that I work so much on these bigger frameworks and CMS sites I kind of dream of the days where all the code in the site was written by me.

So, I'm going to do that. No CMS for my personal site at all. Sure, I'll duplicate a little work but I'm not doing daily posts or anything.
