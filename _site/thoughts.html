      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/bootstrap-customization-ftw">Cherry Picking from Frameworks</a></h2>
      <p>If there is such a thing as front-end framework camps, I have been carrying the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com">Foundation</a> flag for a while. As a full framework, I prefer it over <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap">Bootstrap</a>. I prefer the code style and the use of Sass instead of Less, primarily. I also like that there&rsquo;s less in it and it is more tightly bundled.</p>

<p>However, my team and I don&rsquo;t use a framework for projects. So when I&rsquo;m looking at their docs, it&rsquo;s to determine some best practices for specific modules. This is where Bootstrap excels. Their documentation and their code lends itself to cherry picking more easily than Foundation does. The fact that you can <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html">customize your Bootstrap download</a> sealed the deal on it being the better resource for cherry picking.</p>

<p>As an aside, I think it&rsquo;s great that they are going different directions. Bootstrap seems to be moving towards being a collection of small systems and Foundation is focused on being a single system. It will keep them both growing instead of duplicating and competing, which rocks.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/production-consumption-balance">Production-Shipping Balance</a></h2>
      <p>Some people struggle with a work/life balance. You&rsquo;ll see tons of articles on how people try to keep it in check. I&rsquo;m lucky in that I have a wonderful wife and family that come up with plenty of things for me to do besides work. If it wasn&rsquo;t for them, I would probably &lsquo;work&rsquo; way too much.</p>

<p>Where I have been really struggling lately is in the production/consumption balance. For the past 5 years or so, I have spent a large amount of my non-billable time consuming information about  web design and dev. I&rsquo;m insatiable when it comes to learning about the web. Recently I realized that spending so much time consuming has left me with much less time for producing.</p>

<p>For the past few years, I have probably consumed 10+ things per day. This being some combination of reading articles, checking out sites and watching videos. My read-it-later queue is generally over 100 items at a time. I&rsquo;m significantly slowing down. Lately I&rsquo;ve been more in the 1-5 range per day and I&rsquo;m using that time to produce things: mainly writing and working on a backbone project. My focus now is much heavier on learning by doing instead of learning by reading. We&rsquo;ll see where it takes me.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s why I paid for <a href="http://pinboard.in">pinboard</a> but then left it for <a href="http://kippt.com">Kippt</a>. It&rsquo;s how I judge any service that I&rsquo;m checking out and especially how I read information online. There are probably less than 5 sites that I actually read straight from the site. The rest go to Readability to either read now or saved to read later. Tapbots integrating that into their Twitter app was amazing for me.</p>

<p>This is huge for people that spend lots of time in front of screens. The minimum requirement is usability but aesthetics are used for driving enthusiasm.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/redesign-day">Redesign Day</a></h2>
      <p>One small step for the web, one giant leap for responsive web design. I&rsquo;m being dramatic, but yesterday was a big day for #RWD and the web in general. It was redesign launch day, with <a href="http://elementcreative.com">Element</a> and <a href="http://paravelinc.com">Paravel</a> both showing off their latest versions of their sites. As cool as they are, two web shops releasing responsive redesigns isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/default.aspx">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://disney.com">Disney</a> kind of are, though. Microsoft released only a home page redesign, but it&rsquo;s a great step in the right direction. Disney went further than the home page but still has plenty of content linked that isn&rsquo;t responsiveâ€¦yet. The reason that I see this as important is that they are introducing it to their markets and leading them by doing it. This will be huge for enterprise and entertainment sites.</p>

<p>Wordpress introduced responsive to publishers with their free 2011 theme. This enabled publishers to begin producing content that could then be consumed more easily across a wide range of devices. The Boston Globe lead the charge into news/media delivery and now we will see the demand surge in business and entertainment. With a much wider array of content, there will be fantastic solutions that come out of the teams behind these projects. It is going to be an exciting couple of years.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I listened to 2 different interviews with <a href="http://jarederondu.com">Jared Erondu</a>. The <a href="http://younggunsshow.com">Young Guns Show</a> and <a href="http://theeastwing.net">The East Wing</a> did a great job of both doing interviews with him and getting out different stories and topics. He&rsquo;s a pretty awesome dude and definitely someone to keep an eye on in <a href="http://theindustry.cc">&lsquo;the industry&rsquo;</a>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/ideas">Ideas</a></h2>
      <p>I have too many ideas. I&rsquo;m certainly not alone, it&rsquo;s an effect of being a part of this amazing time for the web. The problem is that having so many ideas and not executing is like carrying baggage. When I see things get released that are close to ideas that I have it is both frustrating and rewarding. I get frustrated that I didn&rsquo;t do it, but pleased that people that I consider much smarter than I am saw similar opportunities.</p>

<p>What I have been working on lately is allowing myself to think through something, play with the idea for a bit and then decide if I&rsquo;m really going to do it or not. If I&rsquo;m not going to start doing it this week, I&rsquo;m writing it off. Execution is the only thing that matters and if I won&rsquo;t set aside the time to execute on them they don&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s hard though, as I&rsquo;m trying to narrow down what to do of my 4 longest living ones.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/startups">Startups</a></h2>
      <p>I read a fantastic post by Paul Graham tonight, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/growth.html">Startup = Growth</a> in which he systematically ripped apart my thoughts on startups. If there is someone who can define what startups are about, it is Paul Graham.</p>

<p>I have misjudged many companies as startups and have been a little indignant about the whole model of &ldquo;eyeballs are greater than revenue&rdquo;. A lot of what he says makes sense and it has put me in the right frame of mind for understanding them. It was long, but fantastic and I highly recommend reading it.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/attitude-reflect-leadership-captain">Attitude Reflect Leadership, Captain</a></h2>
      <p>This weekend, Cherrie and I couldn&rsquo;t resist watching Remember the Titans when we came across it on TV. It&rsquo;s such a fantastic story. Anyhow, there is this one scene when the two future leaders square off about the issues with the team. Bertier says that Julius' &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna get mine&rdquo; attitude is all wrong. Julius replies with &ldquo;attitude reflect leadership, Captain&rdquo;.</p>

<p>It is so true. While his was said in a negative time, I&rsquo;m sharing how awesome it can be in good times. I&rsquo;m the happiest that I have ever been professionally working with the <a href="http://envylabs.com">Envy Labs</a> team. My attitude is absolutely reflecting the leadership.</p>

<p>While we are technically a flat company, there are leaders and they rock. There will never be a time where everyone agrees with every direction or decision, but the leadership at Envy is fantastic. They all have a great mix of leading by example: inspiring with high aspirations while maintaining a relaxed demeanor.</p>

<p>They raise up the whole team and encourage us to be better (people in general) as well as better employees.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/i-love-kippt">I Love Kippt</a></h2>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been a Twitter addict for a few years now. The primary reason that I am addicted is that it is my main way of discovering things related to front-end work. Of course, I dig the social part of having tweetversations but the links are my main reason for going.</p>

<p><a href="http://kippt.com">Kippt</a> has provided the best UI and UX that I have seen for link collectors like myself. It is a gorgeous site and has all of the right features for quickly organizing and discovering links. It is a fantastic design and I love it. So, I&rsquo;m dedicating extra time each day to build up <a href="https://kippt.com/dandenney">my collection</a>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/posts/thoughts/execution-is-all-that-matters">Execution is All That Matters</a></h2>
      <p>Working in the &lsquo;online world&rsquo;, it is hard to not have multiple ideas per day on things that you would like to create. More than anything else, what I have learned is that execution is all that matters.</p>

<p>Shipping is vital. It&rsquo;s not the only thing that matters, but getting your idea into something that people can interact with has to be your number one goal. How you execute (along with some or the random market stuff) will determine how successful your idea is, but you can&rsquo;t know how well you execute until you actually do.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve thought this many times, but I&rsquo;m writing based on Brad Frost&rsquo;s recent release: <a href="http://bradfrost.github.com/this-is-responsive">This is Responsive</a>. I had an idea for something like this and grabbed up a domain (responsv.com) for it. I had an idea, but I didn&rsquo;t take action.</p>

<p>The great part is that the world now has a site like this. Brad has put in a ton of work on it already and it is going to be fantastic. He did some really cool stuff like putting lots of <a href="http://codepen.io/bradfrost">code samples on Codepen</a>. He has a lot of swagger in the responsive group, so I think it is probably better to have someone like him behind this project. I love seeing the great reaction and the numbers on Codepen because it confirms that I at least have ideas for things that people will dig.</p>

<p>That is good and it is getting me moving on my one idea that I haven&rsquo;t been able to kick out of my brain for the past year.</p>
