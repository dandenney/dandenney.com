%p
  I'm in the process of rebuilding my personal site. It kinda sucks that I was more or less forced into it, but I have wanted to do it for a while. I'm taking it as an opportunity to do something very different.

%h2 CMS Free

%p 
  It sounds crazy but I am not going to use any CMS on this site. I have been writing markup for about 11 years and the past 2 have been primarily in a Rails environment. Aside from that, I have some WordPress and ExpressionEngine experience. In all of these, you have to deal with a great deal of markup that isn't of your choosing. Things come in dynamically from the framework, gems, plugins, etc. Inspired by

  Zeldman's recent post
  , I'm going back to my personal site being my playground and I want to choose all of the sand.

%h2 I don't recommend this to everyone

%p This is a personal preference and exploration and it is horribly inefficient for business purposes. However, working on my personal site is a hobby. It is a time for playing and for relaxation. I don't relax when I am pasting code into a WordPress input and reading about how to not have it wrap my sample &lt;script&gt; tags in a &lt;p&gt; tag. I debated on a static site generator but they have a weird feel about them too. Most want to lean towards markdown and have a long list of helpers to learn. For work and efficency these are very good things but I love markup and I want to write it. I just want to write it and I want every piece of markup in this site to be a conscious choice.

%h2 Building in Public

%p
  I don't get a lot of traffic, but those of you who made it here will get to see this process and I'll share how things go. Here are my to-dos:

%ol
  %li 
    Build a list of all the things that I use to rebuild. (ongoing)
    %ul
      %li 15" Macbook Pro
      %li Sublime Text 2
      %li Codekit
      %li Github
      %li Mediatemple Hosting
      %li Typekit
      %li Muji Notebook
      %li Some random pen
      %li Icomoon
      %li xScope
      %li Kuler
      %li 0to255
  %li 
    %strike
      Set up Github, both for versioning and to deploy to the server.
  %li 
    %strike
      Gather the resources that I know I'll need for design (fonts and images).
  %li 
    %strike
      Define how to structure the files.
  %li 
    %strike
      Design the nav.
  %li 
    %strike
      Design the basic post style.
  %li
    Get recent posts back up in the basic post style. (The ones below have content but you'll need your back button)
    %ul
      %li
        %a(href="/posts/front-end-dev/sass-compass-pairing-with-michael-parenteau") Sass and Compass Pairing with Michael Parenteau
      %li 
        %a(href="/posts/front-end-dev/a-sass-noob-using-math-for-flexible-widths") A Sass Noob Using Math for Flexible Widths

%p 
  That will get me started and I'll have a MVW (minimum viable website). Getting the recent posts back up are important to me because I had shared how much a few people had helped me recently and I want those back up so others know how awesome they are.

%h2 Thank you, kinda

%p So while it sucks that some script kiddies started injecting my database with malware, it has gotten me passionate about rebuilding my personal site. So thank you, kinda.
