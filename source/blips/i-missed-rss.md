title: I Missed RSS
date: August 9, 2013

When Google announced that they were shutting down reader, I threw in the towel on RSS feeds as a whole. Every feed I followed was in Google Reader and I used other things just for their UI. I didn't think I'd need it anymore because I'm a Twitter addict, I subscribe to 5-6 email newsletters of links from around the industry, and I regularly check a few sites with links. I figured I was good, but there's definitely that feeling that I'm missing some of the stuff that isn't popular. Or, I'm just an addict.

Either way, I'm starting fresh and filling up a queue on [Feedly](http://www.feedly.com).
